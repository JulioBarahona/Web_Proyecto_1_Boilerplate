# Proyecto 1: React Boilerplate
New React boilerplate that will let all my projects be easily mounted. 

## Get Ready
### Basic programs you need for the commands to work
- Any shape or form to download this repository into you desired folder (I personally recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) )
	- an alternative is to go and open a cmd on the folder you want the repo and use the next command
```
git clone https://github.com/JulioBarahona/Web_Proyecto_1_Boilerplate
```
- NodeJS: This is the bread and butter of all there is in the repo. 
- NPM (Node package manager): if for any reason NPM didnt came with your NodeJS version, I strongly advice to install it too. Here is a good way to do that [HELP](https://www.npmjs.com/) 


## Setup  
1. After this getting the repo, please install the modules by using is commmand. If you dont do this you will not be able to work as fasta as possible.
```
npm install
```

2. Once you started working in some code run this command , it will start the compiling and wil le toyu know about syntax errors and other cool stuff.
```
npm start
```
3. Check your localhost in any browser and see for yourself how the magic begins. Here are some commonly used PORTS. By default the port used in the boilerplate will **localhost:8080**
    * http://localhost:3000/
    * http://localhost:8000/
    * http://localhost:8080/
