# Web_Proyecto_1_Boilerplate
# React-Boilerplate
React boilerplate that will let all my projects be set up with less time and my own taste in coding

## Get Ready
### Basic programs you need for the commands to work
- Any shape or form to download this repository into you desired folder (I personally recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) )
- NodeJS: This is the bread and butter of all there is in the repo. 
- NPM (Node package manager): if for any reason NPM didnt came with your NodeJS version, I strongly advice to install it too. Here is a good way to do that [HELP](https://www.npmjs.com/) 


After this you can run the following lines and the boilerplate will download any packages that are missing, install them and run the boiler plate server

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Setup  
1. Clone the repo. Cloning can be done in many ways. Using GitKraken GUI is the easiest if you dont want to use console commands or others.
2. Once the file is downloaded in you desired file open the comnmand propm and run the following command: 
```
npm install
```
3. Now run this following command. It will install and start the local server setup and install all the packages previously downloaded.
```
npm start
```
4. Check your localhost in any browser and see for yourself how the magic begins. Here are some possible localhost urls commonly used
    * http://localhost:3000/
    * http://localhost:8000/
    * http://localhost:8080/

## Packages 
The packages used in this boilerplate are the following: 
* React
* Redux
* Babel
* Webpack
* ESLint

## Extras
### Good Read Me files
If you want to have a nice **read me** file you should use [this ](https://dillinger.io/) website. Its really useful and lets you see in real time how the file will end up looking. 

### Date of creation
The of all this packages are as of Search Results 2018 November 22. Im a little bit lazy so if there is no need of exact version i wont change this part.
